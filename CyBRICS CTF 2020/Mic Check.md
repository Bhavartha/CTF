# Mic Check (Cyber, Baby, 50 pts)

### Description says: Have you read the game rules? There's a flag there. But this year it's ENCRYPTED, the same way as UserAssist values in Windows

In the game rules page we find the flag `cybrics{Na5JRe_g0_G3u_Z1P_Pu3PX}`

But its encrypted (the same way as UserAssist values in Windows)

UserAssist values are **ROT13** encrypted

So we just rot13 decrypt to get the flag `cybrics{An5WEr_t0_T3h_M1C_Ch3CK}`
